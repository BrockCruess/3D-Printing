### Goal:

Adapt a B, M or B&M Key M.2 drive to a 2.5" SSD enclosure for use with a SATA port, using commonly found adapter boards from Amazon or elsewhere.
Most of these adapters do not come with a 2.5" SSD enclosure, especially the M-Key ones.
This is an exact recreation of the 2.5" SSD enclosure that did come with one of the adapters I found on Amazon - unfortunately it didn't support M-Key so I had to draw this up and print it to work with the enclosureless M-Key adapter I also found on Amazon.

### Print:
- PLA or stronger material is recommended.
- A finer resolution is recommended, 0.1mm worked great for me.
- 100% infill helps with rigidity, and should only use about 17.2g of material per enclosure.


### Use:
- Press the adapter board into the printed enclosure and fasten into place with the four corner screws. It should fit nice and tight.
- There is no "bottom" to this enclosure as the PCB board takes up the space that the bottom plate would - this is normal for this style of adapter.

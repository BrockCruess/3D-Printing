Replace the twin model cooling fans and their separate ducts with a single 5015 blower fan and a new triple output duct.
Also replace the main extruder cover, keeping the top piece but removing the green bottom piece.


### Parts:

1. WINSINN 5015 24V Blower Fan

2. M3 hex screw and nut kit


### Print:

The duct and fan mount is a trickier print. It requires supports, 0.1mm layer height is recommended, will likely require some filing to get the fitment and screw hole alignment right.
I didn't design this part so it's not as precise. It's from [this link](https://www.printables.com/model/357945-ankermake-m5-5015-fan-duct-and-extruder-case)

I did revise the extruder cover to reinforce the screw holes as they were too thin in the original design.
Print the extruder with supports so the holes and tabs turn out nice.
You'll need to trim out some material and snip off the 2 front right tabs if you're planning on doing the throat fan mod that's in this repo.
But that's for another time.


### Use:

Remove the original extruder cover and throat fans.
Use M3x12 screws to attach the new fan duct to the 2 front right screw holes that used to hold the original model cooling fan bracket.
Set the height of the duct so that the fan exhaust ports sit 1mm above the extruder nozzle for maximum efficiency.
Use M3x20 screws and nuts to fasten a 24V 5015 blower fan to the new bracket and plug it into the right side model fan plug.
Attach the new extruder cover and you're done.

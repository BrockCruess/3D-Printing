### Goal:

Allow any standard 1kg 55mm ID spool to smoothly rotate on the M5's original spool holder.


### Print:

- Print the sleeve at 10% infill with the lip at the bottom at.
- Print the locking key flat with the lip up at 15% infill.


### Use:

- Remove the alan bolt from the back of the M5 spool stand's silver bar.
- Slip this new sleeve over the silver bar with the lip at the back and remount the bar.
- The locking key will slip over the hex shape at the end of the silver bar, preventing the spool from slipping off the sleeve while rotating.

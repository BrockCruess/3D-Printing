Slides over the mainboard's heat sink, replacing the noisy stock 30mm fan with an adapter that holds a 40mm x 10mm fan, quietly blowing more air.



### Parts:

1. Winsinn 40mm 24V 4010 Fan

2. M3 screw kit

OR

1. 3 pin Noctua NF-A4x10 FLX

2. Noctua NA-VC1 24V to 12V Buck Converter

3. Plug pin header kit and crimp tool

4. Heat shrink tubing or electrical tape

5. M3 screw kit



### Print:

Print 2 of them flat side down. Very simple print but the more detailed the better with small parts. I printed at 0.1mm layer height.



### Use:

Slide them over the ends of the mainboard's heat sink so they sit on top and fasten a new 4010 fan to them using the original 2 M3 screws and 2 more M3 x 16 screws.
Most use a Winsinn 40mm 24V (4010) as the plug end and voltage are the same as the stock fan, by the time you've done all of my silencing mods, the Winsinn 4010 ends up being the loudest fan.



### Here's how I achieved total silence:

Buy a 3 pin Noctua NF-A4x10 FLX and a Noctua NA-VC1 24V to 12V Buck Converter.
Buy a basic 2.54mm pin header kit and crimper. You'll only need the female ends.
Plug the Noctua fan straight into the buck converter's 12V output end.
Clip the side off the plastic plug housing on the extension wire that the fan comes with so that it plugs into the buck converter's 24V input end (which is 4 pin but just line up the 3 pins correctly).
Just look at it and you'll know which side to clip off.
Snip the extension wire a few inches down and strip the wire ends on the red and black wires.
Crimp on 2 female pin headers and put some heat shrink tubing (or electrical tape) around them to make sure they don't ever make contact with each other.
Individually plug the 2 female pins (black and red wires corresponding with the original fan's wires) onto the male header pins on the mainboard.
If they don't fit very tight, lightly squeez the ends of the pin headers with pliers to tighten the holes up. They should never slip off on their own.
Bundle the extra wire together with a cable tie or some electrical tape, tuck it to the side of the mainboard.
You don't need the third (yellow) fan wire because no RPM signal is needed, the van is speed controlled/activated by voltage through the red wire.
You now have a 24V Noctua fan whispering into your mainboard's heat sink whenever things get hot down there.

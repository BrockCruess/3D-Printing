Slides over the mainboard's heat sink, replacing the noisy stock 30mm fan with an adapter that holds a 40mm x 10mm fan, quietly blowing more air.



### Parts:

1. 3 pin Noctua NF-A4x10 FLX

2. Noctua NA-VC1 24V to 12V Buck Converter

4. M3 hex screw kit



### Print:

Print 2 of them flat side down. Very simple print but the more detailed the better with small parts. I printed at 0.1mm layer height.



### Use:

Slide the printed adapters over the ends of the mainboard's heat sink so they sit on top and fasten the Noctua fan to them using the original 2 M3 screws and 2 more M3 x 12 screws.
Plug the Noctua fan straight into the buck converter's 12V output end.
Clip the side off the plastic plug housing on the 3 to 2 pin adapter wire that the fan comes with so that it plugs into the buck converter's 24V input end (which is 4 pin but just line up the 3 pins correctly).
The 2 pin adapter will plug directly into the original header on the mainboard.
Bundle the extra wire together with a cable tie or some electrical tape, tuck it up above the mainboard.

### Goal:

Remove the backing of BeeLink SER3 (and likely any same size mini PC) and replace it with a mount for a 120mm fan to blow straight onto the internals.
Ideal for running an SER3 in a closet or somewhere with limited airflow. A USB-powered fan is the easiest solution I've found.
I included a hole that extends from one of the corners which is useful for hanging the PC from a carabiner or hook.


### Print:

- Print the 120mm bracket with the extended ears at the top using supports.
- The top retainer just prints flat.


### Use:

- Mount a 120mm fan to the bracket using longer fan screws and nuts.
- The screws should go from the inside of the bracket to the outside, as there are counter-sunk holes on the inside. This will ensure a flush fit against the mini PC.
- Remove the bottom plate off the SER3 and lay it into the 120mm bracket open-bottom first.
- Secure the SER3 in the bracket with the top retainer and use some typical short coarse-thread case fan screws to self-tap and secure it all together.
